# jio

JIO is an integrated Java API that combines different open-source IO Libraries like JSSC, HID4JAVA and USB4JAVA to allow seemless integration of different IO Devices like Bill Acceptors, Card Readers and RFIDs.

## Note
This might not be a fully working code but has been used in a lot of production sites across the globe.
I will try to create a demo project for public github's purpose.
